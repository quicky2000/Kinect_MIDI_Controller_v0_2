# Kinect MIDI Controller v0.2

Project origin : https://benxtan.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/kinect-midi-controller-kmidic-on-a-mac/

The idea is to modify it to make it run on my Laptop that has no Kinect and no MIDI peripherals and look at the running code

## Processing configuration

* Install Processing 3 from https://processing.org/download/
* Install Video library from Processing->Sketch -> Import Library

Need to download https://github.com/processing/processing-video/releases/tag/r6-v2.0-beta4 to have webcam work on Kubuntu 18.04

Replace previously installed video library ( ~/sketchbook/libraries/video ) by the beta one

## Run

Launch processing then open sketch Kinect_MIDI_Controller_v0_2.pde
